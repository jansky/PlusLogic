To install the PlusLogic library and interpreter run the following commands:

$ make
$ sudo make install

NOTE: In order to build the interpreter you need the GNU readline library.

To remove object files as well as built libraries and programs, run:

$ make clean

To uninstall the PlusLogic library and interpreter, run:

$ sudo make uninstall

During the installation process, the makefile copies libpluslogic.a to /usr/lib, pluslogic.h to /usr/include and pluslogicint to /usr/bin. Change this as needed.
